# Responsiveness_Portfolio

This is a three step project, where one part was the portfolio with all the homework/projects that will be worked on throughout the Upenn's bootcamp program. Another part was about me, where, I described about my background, what college I attended and how I got into coding. The next part of this homework was contact information. The point of this homework was to make working responsive websites that can be used on an iphone, tablet, Desktop, ipad, etc. While the website is being minimized the text, images, text, and the nav bar will change, adjust, and change some of the layouts.
